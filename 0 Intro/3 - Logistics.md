## Contact

You are welcome to email me at any time: [evan@pdxcodeguild.com](mailto:evan@pdxcodeguild.com). We will also have a channel on the [PDX Code Guild Slack](https://portlandcodeguild.slack.com/).

## Parking

We issue parking passes for actively enrolled students. If you park here please use the last 12 spots in the parking cul-de-sac behind the building.

## Bikes

Bikes can be locked up out front of the building, or in the basement parking lot. To get to the basement, take the elevator or stairs from the lobby. You'll have to walk around to the front door to get back up, unfortunately. Bikes are not allowed in the classroom.

## Classroom

Please keep the classroom clean. There is not a printer available for public use. You're welcome to hang out and work in the common area whenever PDX Code Guild is open, which is typically from 9 AM to 9:30 PM.

## Food

You are welcome to eat in the classroom at any time. If you keep food in the refrigerator in the classroom, **write your name on it.** Don't eat other people's food.
