# List of Terms in Python

- argument
    - snyonymous with 'parameter', the values passed into a function
- boolean
	- True or False, the result of == != < <= > >=
- class
    - a way to define a type, a 'class of objects'
- comment
	- a way of writing text in code that's ignored by the interpreter
	- e.g. `# this is a comment`
- comparison
    - == != < <= > >=
- conditional
    - if, elif
- declaration
    - to 'declare' a value, to say that it exists (often with a given value, e.g. `x = 5`)
- dunder
	- double underscore '__'
- element
    - an element of a list
    - e.g. in `[1, 2, 3]` `1` is the 'first element'
- escape sequence
    - a way to specify special characters in a string literal
    - e.g. `\n` is a newline, `\t` is a tab, `\'` is a single-quote, `\"` is a double-quote, `\\` is a backslash.
- exception
    - a way in python to indicate that an error occurred, e.g. accessing an element of a list beyond its end, trying to divide by zero
- expression
    - a section of code that evaluates to a value
- float
	- a floating point number, e.g. 5.6
- function
    - an isolated section of code that's supposed to perform a specific operation
- index
    - an integer representing the position of an element in a list, or a character in a string
- instance
    - as opposed to 'type', an actual object, not just a 'blueprint'
- int
	- an integer, e.g. 5, 12, -231
- iteration
	- repeating a block of code by looping
- list
	- an ordered collection of elements, denoted by []
	- `nums = [5, 6, 7]`
	- `names = ['jack', 'jill', 'jane']`
- literal
	- a value put directly into source code
- loop
    - repeatly executing a section of code
    - `for` and `while` are the kinds of loops in python
- method
    - a special type of function, associated with the instance of a type
    - e.g. `'hello world'.split(' ')`
- module
    - an organization unit in Python, a `.py` file represents a module
- modulus ('mod')
	- the 'remainder function' e.g. 5%3=2
	- it's useful for wrapping past the end of an array, or confining an int to a range
- parameter
    - snyonymous with 'argument', the values passed into a function
- statement
    -  a section of code that performs a complete operation
- type
    - synonymous with 'class', general characteristics shared among different instances
    - e.g. string, int, float, list
    - you can access an object's type with `type(o)`, e.g. `print(type(5))` will print `int`
- variable
	- e.g. algebra, a name that stands for a value 
    - the name can be made with letters, numbers, and underscores, it just can't start with a number
