# Week 1, day 1

The following is inspired by, and in some parts taken from, a famous computer science textbook [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-9.html).

## Elements of a Programming Language 

> The acts of the mind, wherein it exerts its power over simple ideas, are chiefly these three: 1. Combining several simple ideas into one compound one, and thus all complex ideas are made. 2. The second is bringing two ideas, whether simple or complex, together, and setting them by one another so as to take a view of them at once, without uniting them into one, by which it gets all its ideas of relations. 3. The third is separating them from all other ideas that accompany them in their real existence: this is called abstraction, and thus all its general ideas are made.

When learning a new language, your chief concern should be to ask yourself the following 3 questions:

1. What are the primitive expressions/statements?
1. What are the means of combination?
1. What are the means of abstraction?

Our first lesson will be to provide some simple answers to the above 3 questions.

Of course, learning the rules of chess doesn't make you a master chess player. But we have to start with the rules.  Learning these rules and techniques will empower you, theoretically, to construct almost any program imaginable. But it takes years of practice to become a master programmer. Some say it [takes 10 years](http://www.norvig.com/21-days.html), but even that sounds a little short to me!

Welcome to the beginning of a long journey! Just remember: don't focus too much on the destination. Programming is a lot of fun the whole way through!
