# Lab 5: Personal Portfolio

Did you know GitHub will let you use a repo to host a static website? Follow [this tutorial](https://pages.github.com/) to create your own site. This will be a separate repo from your class repo, but do not place your other labs here. In order to make the GitHub pages deployment process as easy as possible, name your repo `<username>.github.io`.
