# Lab 2: Blog

Let's make the template of a blog with a title, top-nav, footer, sidebar, and multiple posts. Use the [semantic elements](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp) header, nav, section, and footer. You can make generate fake content using [Hipster Ipsum](https://hipsum.co/), [Doggo Ipsum](https://doggoipsum.com/), or [Bacon Ipsum](https://baconipsum.com/). 

Make sure you have a [responsive design](../docs/09%20-%20CSS%20Responsive%20Design.md) that offers different, legible layouts for phone, tablet, and desktop screen sizes. You can test this in the broswer devtools. Don't forget to use cascading min-width media queries for a mobile first design, and remember to include the responsive meta tag in your HTML.

It needs to look professional, but this does not mean it needs to be complicated. A clean, simple, minimalist layout with custom color pallate, fonts, and subtle backgrounds or whitespace works great. For examples of simple yet attractive design, check out:

## Part 1:

Create the HTML structure for your blog, with all content included.

## Part 2:

Create your mobile version, using the styling of your choice.

## Part 3:

Use ```min-width``` media queries to add a tablet layout using flexbox. Customize your styling as needed. You probably want your breakpoint between phone and tablet widths to be somewhere around 640-768px.

## Part 4:

Finally, add your desktop layout. Customize styling as needed. A good breakpoint for desktop screen sizes is around 960-1100px.
