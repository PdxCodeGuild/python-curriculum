# Lab 12: Any API in Vue

Choose any API and write a page to interact with it. Be warned: some have particular security restrictions, and some return results in XML (which makes data more difficult to parse). You can view long lists of public APIs [here](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis), [here](https://github.com/abhishekbanthia/Public-APIs), and [here](https://apilist.fun/).  

Your page should take in some sort of user input and return different results based on that input, and your page should offer some sort of interactivity in the results. You should also apply some sort of basic professional styling -- using a CSS framework is totally fine. Your webpage should utilize Vue to build the interface and Axios for making ajax requests.

## User API

There are several APIs to get fake user data which can be used to develop and test front-ends. Show a list of users with their attributes. You may also add a user detail page and pagination.
