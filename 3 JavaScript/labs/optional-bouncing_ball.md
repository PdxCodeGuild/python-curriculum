# Lab 8: Bouncing Ball


Let's use an HTML canvas and an animation loop to draw a bouncing ball. Create an HTML page with a `canvas element`, preferably with a border so you can see the boundaries. Canvases require that `width` and `height` be set as attributes, rather than though CSS.

```html
<canvas width="500" height="500"></canvas>
```

Use the following to define a 'ball' object. The attributes `px` and `py` represent the ball's location, and are initialized to a random place on the canvas, `width` and `height` are the dimensions of the canvas. The attributes `vx` and `vy` represent the ball's velocity.

```javascript
let ball = {
    radius: 4,
    px: Math.random()*width,
    py: Math.random()*height,
    vx: (2*Math.random()-1)*10,
    vy: (2*Math.random()-1)*10
};
```

We can draw the ball by getting the 2D rendering context for the canvas. For more info about drawing, check [here](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_canvas.asp).


```javascript
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.arc(ball.px, ball.py, ball.radius, 0, 2 * Math.PI, false);
ctx.fillStyle = 'green';
ctx.fill();
```

We'll use `requestAnimationFrame` to update the ball's position and re-draw it each frame. You can detect when a ball hits a side when its x-position or y-position goes beyond the boundaries of the canvas. When this happens, reset its location to be within the boundaries, and negate its velocity depending on which side it hit. When the ball hits the left or right side, negate its x-velocity. When the ball hits the top or bottom side, negate its y-velocity. This will cause it to "bounce" off the sides.

```JavaScript
function main_loop() {
    // update the ball's position
    // check if it hit a boundary
    // draw the ball
    window.requestAnimationFrame(main_loop);
}
window.requestAnimationFrame(main_loop);
```

## Version 2

- Add some gravity, which is a constant downward acceleration. We can represent this by a constant value we add to the ball's y-velocity each frame.

- Also add some friction. Each time the ball makes contact with a boundary, try multiplying its x-velocity and y-velocity by 0.99. This means each time it hides a side, it'll lose 1% of its velocity.

## Version 3 (optional) (other options)

- Instead of using `clearRect`, use `fillRect` with some opacity, this will result in a streaking effect.

- Add multiple balls, each with their own radius, and mass (which would effect their acceleration).

- Have balls bounce off of eachother ([link](https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/when-worlds-collide-simulating-circle-circle-collisions--gamedev-769))

- Add gravitational attraction between balls: the acceleration due to gravity can be calculated using [Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation#Modern_form)
